package main

// Given a map[int]int, return the sums of all keys and all values (return two separate sums) in the map without using range or the [] operator. This exercise is significantly more challenging than the others; you will need to carefully consult runtime/map.go to reverse engineer how Goâ€™s maps are represented, starting with the hmap struct.
