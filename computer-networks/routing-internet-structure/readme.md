# Routing, and the Structure of the Internet

## Traceroute

> Program used to determine the path between two hosts on the Internet.

### How it works?

It exploits the TTL field in the IP header by incrementing it from 1 till it reaches the destination.
ICMP package

### Questions

* Sometimes nothing happens. It triggers the initial PING but no response??
* It gets stucked after the sixth hop
* If I trigger traceroute some traffic comes in ?
